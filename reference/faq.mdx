## Where is my data stored?

All of your data, including command history, environment data, and output and all metadata is stored *locally* on your machine in the `~/.waveterm` directory.  None of that information ever leaves your machine.  In the future we may launch cloud features to support terminal sharing, shared workspaces, shared playbooks, and terminal backup/sync.  These will *opt-in*.  We'll never release an update that moves your *private* data off your machine without your explicit consent.

## What telemetry do you collect and send?  Can I opt-out?

Wave telemetry is very minimal, anonymized, completely optional, and you can opt out at any time.  In fact we allow you opt-out in the welcome screen when you first run Wave!  If you'd like to change your telemetry setting after the first run, you can using the Wave settings screen (link in the bottom left of the application).  Please consider leaving telemetry on to support us.  We use the telemetry data to track general usage which helps us keep Wave funded and growing.

## What shells does Wave Terminal support?

We currently only support `bash`.  Your environment (including variables, functions, and aliases) is read from the standard bash startup files (.bash_profile).  In order to customize Wave's environment at startup Wave will set the environment variable `WAVESHELL`.  If you are currently using `zsh`, you might have to transfer some of your `.zprofile` setup into your `.bash_profile`. See [Using Wave Terminal with zsh](https://docs.waveterm.dev/reference/zsh) for more information.

## Why do international characters appear as question marks?

It is a known issue that Wave Terminal does not support international unicode characters yet. We are investigating a solution and tracking the issue [here](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/88)

## How do I specify SSH options such as PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes?

Currently there is no way to specify these option in the Connections UI. A workaround is to add the options to your ~/.ssh/config file. Wave Terminal uses ssh natively under the hood and so any options set in your ssh config will be picked up by Wave directly.

## How can I disable automatic update checks?

By default, Wave will query our GitHub releases feed to determine if any new releases have been published. This check happens once on launch and then again every 8 hours. We use the unauthenticated GitHub REST API and while we do not collect any telemetry on these calls, we cannot guarantee that GitHub will not collect its own telemetry.

If you would like to disable the automatic update checks, you can toggle the "Check for Updates" button in the Settings to the off position (the white circle should be on the left and the button should be grey).

## What is your business model, how do you plan on making money?

We are committed to offering Wave free to all developers (free as in speech and free as in beer). Next year, we plan on introducing *opt-in* features for teams (collaboration and sharing) which will require a paid subscription.  In general, anything that runs locally, on your own machine, using your own resources will be free.  Anything that uses our servers and our resources will be paid.

## How can I change the font in Wave?

Right now we don't support changing the font. We plan on supporting this in the future, along with other font settings. Please see [Issue #83](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/83) and feel free to leave feedback on your specific usecase. 

## Are ligatures supported in Wave?

Wave Terminal uses the JetBrains Mono font which includes 142 code-specific ligatures. These ligatures are supported in the command prompt area and in the terminal output.
