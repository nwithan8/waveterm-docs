Welcome to our Slash Command Reference Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to streamline your workflow in Wave using intuitive commands.
Here, you'll find detailed explanations on how to manage various settings and configurations in Wave related to sessions and windows, client settings, editing and viewing files inline, and much more.

## /bookmark

Commands that allow you to set and delete single bookmarks.

### /bookmark:delete

Remove a bookmark.

### /bookmark:set

Add a bookmark.

## /bookmarks

Commands that allow you to manage multiple bookmarks.

### /bookmarks:show

Show all bookmarks.

## /chat
Ask the AI-assistant a question from the terminal.

```
/chat How do I resolve a merge conflict?
```

## /clear

Clear all commands from the current window.

```
Usage:
clear
/clear
```

Both with and without the slash are allowed. Clear takes no arguments.

## /client

Commands that allow you to change and show client settings and information.

### /client:set

Update client settings, currently only supports termfont size. This will update the font size used in the terminal, can be set from 8-15 (px).

`Usage: /client:set termfontsize=10`

### /client:show

Shows client version information and settings.

## /codeedit

View and edit files inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting, code folding, and completion.

```
Usage:
codeedit [filename]
/codeedit [filename]

[lang=javascript] codeedit [filename]
[lang=json] codeedit hello.json
```
Both with and without the slash are allowed. Filename resolves against the current remote and current working directory.

Shortcuts:

- `Cmd-S` - Saves current file
- `Cmd-D` - Closes the editor. Note, this will prevent future saves (and shrink the editor to fit the current size of the content).
- `Cmd-F` - Search the current file for a string using _whole word_, _regex_ and _match case_ options. `Cmd-F` also supports _find and replace_ by simply clicking the green dropdown arrow in the find box.

**Note:** Codeedit also includes a live preview feature for Markdown files. To activate, open a Markdown file in Codeedit and click the `show preview` button located in the top right corner. This feature enables simultaneous editing and rendering, offering a side-by-side view of your Markdown source and its live output for efficient and immediate feedback.

**Note:** See [codeview](#codeview) to view files in a _view only_ mode using the same native UI.

## /codeview

View a text file inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting and code folding.

```
Usage:
codeview [filename]
/codeview [filename]
