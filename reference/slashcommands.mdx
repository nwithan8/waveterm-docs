Welcome to our Slash Command Reference Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to streamline your workflow in Wave using intuitive commands.
Here, you'll find detailed explanations on how to manage various settings and configurations in Wave related to sessions and windows, client settings, editing and viewing files inline, and much more.

## /bookmarks
Commands that effect bookmarks.

### /bookmarks:delete
Remove a bookmark.

### /bookmarks:set
Add a bookmark.

## /clear

Clear all commands from the current window.

```
Usage:
clear
/clear
```

Both with and without the slash are allowed. Clear takes no arguments.

## /client

Commands that allow you to change and show client settings and information.

### /client:set

Update client settings, currently only supports termfont size. This will update the font size used in the terminal, can be set from 8-15 (px).

`Usage: /client:set termfontsize=10`

### /client:show

Shows client version information and settings.

## /codeedit

View and edit a text file inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting, code folding, and completion.

```
Usage:
codeedit [filename]
/codeedit [filename]
[lang=javascript] codeedit [filename]
[lang=json] codeedit hello.json
```
Both with and without the slash are allowed. Filename resolves against the current remote and current working directory. Once you are editing, you can save the file using `Cmd-S`. Closing the editor (using `Cmd-D`) will prevent future saves (and shrink the editor to fit the current size of the content).

**Note:** A live preview of Markdown files can also be found in codedit by clicking the `show preview` button in the top right of the editor. This allows you to edit and render Markdown content in real-time, displaying the output adjacent to the code editor for convenient and immediate visual feedback.

## /codeview

View a text file inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting and code folding.

```
Usage:
codeview [filename]
/codeview [filename]
[lang=javascript] codeview [filename]
[lang=json] codeview hello.json
```

Both with and without the slash are allowed. Filename resolves against the current remote and current working directory.
